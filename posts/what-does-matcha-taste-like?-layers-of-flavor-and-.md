> **Summary**:
> Matcha tastes grassy, smooth, and rich in umami. Good ceremonial matcha is creamy and balanced, with sweet or nutty undertones and almost no bitterness. Some varieties also carry marine depth, like kelp broth, or rare floral hints. Matcha lattes taste milder, creamy, and lightly sweet, while plain tea shows its full vegetal and savory edge. Unlike coffee, matcha feels calm, with steady energy and a layered taste.
